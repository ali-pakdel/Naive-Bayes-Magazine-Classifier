# Naive-Bayes-Magazine-Classifier

This project delves into the application of classification techniques, specifically focusing on the Naive Bayes Classifier, to categorize magazines based on their subjects. The classification process involves the utilization of Bayes' Theorem and employs a Bag of Words Model for efficient text representation.

## Naive Bayes Classifier

The Naive Bayes Classifier, known for its simplicity and efficiency, assumes independence among predictors. Widely used across diverse domains, this classification technique proves effective in discerning patterns within datasets.

## Bag of Words Model

The Bag of Words Model serves as a prevalent representation technique in natural language processing and information retrieval. Within this project, it will play a crucial role in preprocessing and representing text data extracted from magazines.

## Problem Description

The dataset under examination contains information from various magazines, segregated into a training set (`train.csv`) and a test set (`test.csv`). The primary objective is to harness the power of the Naive Bayes Classifier, coupled with the Bag of Words Model, to analyze and classify magazines based on their respective subjects.
